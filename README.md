## :tractor: Example Usage

### Upload a new iOS app

```yaml
      - name: Upload to Appetize
        uses: appetizeio/github-action-appetize@v1.0.4
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.APPETIZE_API_TOKEN }}
          appFile: test/app.zip
          platform: 'ios'
```

### Upload an existing Android app

```yaml
      - name: Upload to Appetize
        uses: appetizeio/github-action-appetize@v1.0.4
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.APPETIZE_API_TOKEN }}
          publicKey: ${{ secrets.APPETIZE_PUBLIC_KEY }}
          appFile: test/app.apk
          platform: 'android'
```

## ðŸ›  Developer Setup

### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
npm run build && npm run package
```

### Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos, so we will check in the packed dist folder. 

Then run `package` (this uses [ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) under the hood):
```bash
 npm run package
 ```
and push the results:
```bash
 git add dist
 git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
 git push origin releases/{version}
```

The action is now published! ðŸŽ‰
